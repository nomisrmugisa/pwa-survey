7.Risk Management
7.1 Risk Management Programme
7.1.1 Standard
Managers and leaders work collaboratively to develop, implement and maintain
effective risk management systems in the organisation.
Standard Intent: To plan effectively, the organisation must be aware of all relevant risks. The
goal is to prevent accidents and injuries, maintain safe and secure conditions for patients,
families, staff, volunteers and visitors, and reduce and control hazards and risks.
  
Risk management includes:
  
•                Comprehensive inspection of the facility
•                Planning all aspects of the risk management programme
•                Implementation of the programme
•                Education of staff
•                Testing and monitoring the programme,  and
•                Periodic review and revision of the programme.
  
Monitoring of all aspects of the programme provides valuable data to make improvements in
the programme and further reduce risks within the organisation.

7.2 Occupational Health and Safety
7.2.1 Standard
As part of the risk management programme an occupational health and safety
system is implemented in accordance with current legislation.
Standard Intent: Legislation describes the health and safety measures to be implemented by
organisations. In Botswana this is covered by the various legislation.
In terms of this Act, committee members and representatives must be appointed or
nominated in order to ensure the safety of staff, patients and visitors. Where the staff
establishment is less than fifty (50), the requirement for a committee falls away, but the
functions must continue. This could possibly be included in the management activities and
be included on the agenda of the management team.

7.Risk Management
7.4 Fire Safety
7.4.1 Standard
As part of the risk management programme, the organisation implements structured
systems to ensure fire safety.
Standard Intent: Fire is an ever-present risk in a healthcare organisation. An organisation needs
to plan for:
  
•                The prevention of fires through the reduction of risks, such as the safe storage and
handling of potentially flammable materials
•                Safe and unobstructed means of exit in the event of fire
•                Clearly depicted fire escape routes
•                Inspection reports from the local fire departments,  and
•                Suppression mechanisms such as water hoses, chemical suppressants or sprinkler
systems. These actions when combined give patients, families, staff and visitors adequate
time to safely exit the facility in the event of a fire or smoke. These actions are effective no
matter what the age, size or construction of the facility.
  
The organisation's fire safety plan identifies the:
  
•                Frequency of inspection, testing and maintenance of fire protection and safety
•                systems, consistent with requirements
•                Process for testing, at least twice per year, the plan for the safe evacuation of the
facility in the event of a fire or smoke
•                Necessary education of staff to effectively protect and evacuate patients when an
emergency occurs,  and
•                Participation of each staff member in at least one emergency preparedness test per
year.
  
All inspections, testing and maintenance are documented.
The organisation develops and implements a policy and plan to eliminate smoking in the
organisation's facilities, or to limit smoking to designated non-patient care areas.

7.5.1 Standard
The organisation develops a plan to respond to likely community emergencies,
epidemics, and natural or other disasters.
Standard Intent: There are two elements to a disaster plan. Firstly, individual facilities must
have emergency preparedness. Secondly, the capabilities of these individual facilities must
be catalogued and integrated into a coordinated disaster plan, which involves other facilities
and organisations within the community. It is this integration and coordination, which is the
responsibility of senior management. The disaster plan must address closure of individual
facilities.

7.Risk Management
7.6.2 Standard
There is a programme for the early detection and management of events caused by
biological and chemical agents.
Standard Intent: The public health system must be able to respond to the deliberate release of
biological and chemical agents. A Biological and Chemical Agent (BCA) plan is usually
nationally or is regionally based and must address early detection and containment of such
events.
 
Each organisation will assess the relevance of their involvement in a Biological and
Chemical Agents plan and will assess this as a risk for exclusion or inclusion.  The
organisation has liaised with public or governmental entities to understand their expectations
in this regard.

7.Risk Management
7.7 Prevention and Control of Infections
7.7.1 Standard
As part of the risk management programme the organisation designs and
implements a coordinated programme to reduce the risk of infections in patients
and healthcare workers.
Standard Intent: For an infection prevention and control programme to be effective, it must be
comprehensive, encompassing both patient care and employee health. The programme is
appropriate to the size and geographic location of the organisation, the services offered by
the organisation and the patients seen by the organisation.
  
One or more individuals, acting on a full-time or part-time basis, direct the programme. Their
qualifications depend on the activities they will carry out and may be met through education,
training and experience. Coordination involves communication with all parts of the
organisation to ensure that the programme is continuous and proactive.
  
Information is essential to an infection control programme. Information supports the tracking
of risks, rates and trends in nosocomial infections, data analysis, interpretation and
presentation of findings.
  
In addition, infection control programme data and information are managed with those of the
organisation's quality management and improvement programme.
