6.Management of Information
6.1  Planning
6.1.1 Standard
The organisation plans and implements processes to meet the information needs of
those who carry out dispatch activities or provide clinical services, those who
manage the organisation and those outside the organisation who require data and
information from the organisation.
Standard Intent: Information is generated and used during patient care and for safely and
effectively managing an organisation. The ability to capture and provide information requires
effective planning. Planning incorporates input from a variety of sources:
•                                 the care providers
•                                 the organisation's managers and leaders, and
•                     those outside the organisation who need or require data or information about the
organisation's operational and care processes.
  
The most urgent information needs of those sources influence the organisation's information
management strategies and its ability to implement those strategies. The strategies are
appropriate for the organisation's size, complexity of services, availability of trained staff and
other human and technical resources.
  
The plan is comprehensive and includes all the departments and services of the
organisation.

6.Management of Information
6.1.3 Standard
The information plan is implemented and supported by sufficient staff and other
resources.
Standard Intent: The organisation's information management plan, once complete and
approved as necessary, is implemented. The organisation provides the staff, technology and
other resources necessary to implement the plan and meet the identified information needs
of the healthcare providers, managers and others.
 
Individuals in the organisation who generate, collect, analyse and use data and information
are educated and trained to effectively participate in managing information. Such education
and training enables these individuals to:
  
•                understand the security and confidentiality of data and information
•                use measurement instruments, statistical tools and data analysis  
          methods
•                assist in interpreting data
•                use data and information to help in decision making
•                educate and support the participation of patients and families in care processes, and
           use indicators to assess and improve care and work processes.
  
Individuals are appropriately educated and trained in regard to their responsibilities, job
descriptions and data and information needs.
  
Information management technology represents a major investment of resources for a
health organisation. For this reason, technology is carefully matched to the current and
future needs of the organisation and the organisation's resources. Available technology
needs to be integrated with existing information management processes and serves to
integrate the activities of all the departments and services of the organisation. This level of
coordination requires that key clinical and managerial staff participate in the selection
process. The management of the organisation ensures that staff members have the required
supplies, registers, check lists, forms, etc. required for data management.

6.4.2 Standard
Organisation policy identifies those authorised to make entries in the patient record
and determines the record's content and format.
Standard Intent: Each organisation has a process to assess the quality and completeness of
patient records. That process is a part of the organisation's performance improvement
activities and is carried out regularly. Clinical record review is based on a representative
sample (a sample representing the practitioners providing care and the types of care
provided).The medical staff, nursing staff and other relevant clinical professionals who are
authorised to make entries in the patient record conduct the review process. The focus of
the review is on the quality of the record and clinical information available during the care
process. Thus, the organisation's record review process includes the review of the records
of patients currently receiving care as well as the records of discharged patients.
