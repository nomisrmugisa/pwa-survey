2.2 Personnel Orientation and Training
2.2.1 Standard
The manager of the emergency medical service ensures that there is a written,
planned and organised orientation and induction programme available for new

service and how his or her specific responsibilities contribute to the service's mission.  This
is accomplished through a general orientation to the service and his or her role in the
service, and a specific orientation to the job responsibilities of his or her position.

2.3 Industrial Relations
2.3.1 Standard
Sound industrial relations, which are based on current labour legislation, are

Standard Intent: Consistent application of fair labour practice, grievance and disciplinary
procedures, and dismissal, demotion and retrenchment policies and procedures is essential
to prevent labour unrest with its consequent negative effects on patient care. Membership of
staff in trade unions and/or health professional organisations must be encouraged and there
must be negotiation and consultation between these bodies, management of the
organisation and the staff to promote harmonious working relationships. Current
employment policies need to be known and applied.
  
The organisation's leaders thus have a responsibility to:
  
•            be conversant with all current labour laws and regulations
•            educate personnel managers in relevant aspects of labour law
•            ensure that policies and procedures are developed,  and
•            ensure that these policies and procedures are effectively implemented.

2.4 Credentialing of Staff
2.4.1 Standard
The organisation has an effective process for gathering, verifying and evaluating the
credentials (licence, education, training and experience) of those health
professionals who are permitted to provide patient care without supervision.
Standard Intent: The organisation needs to ensure that it has qualified health professional staff
members that appropriately match its mission, resources and patient needs. To ensure such
a match, the organisation evaluates staff members' credentials at the time of their
appointment.
  
An individual's credentials consist of an appropriate current registration, completion of
professional education and any additional training and experience. The organisation
develops a process to gather this information, verify its accuracy where possible and
evaluate it in relation to the needs of the organisation and its patients. This process can be
carried out by the organisation or by an external agency such as a ministry of health in the
case of public organisations. The process applies to all types and levels of employed
persons (employed, honorary, contract and private practitioners).
  
Evaluating an individual's credentials is the basis for two decisions: whether this individual
can contribute to fulfilling the organisation's mission and meeting patient needs, and, if so,
what clinical services this individual is qualified to perform.
  
These two decisions are documented and the latter decision is the basis for evaluating the
individual's on-going performance. Following appointment, the organisation confirms the
qualifications of professional staff, including the authenticity of qualifications and licensure
and their experience and competence. This includes clinical qualifications and also
qualifications to operate vehicles. The process takes into account relevant laws and
regulations.
