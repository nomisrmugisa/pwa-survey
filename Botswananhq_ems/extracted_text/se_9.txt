9.1 Buildings, Plant, Installations and Machinery
9.1.1 Standard
Functional facilities are available to provide safety and comfort for staff.
Standard Intent: Laws, regulations and inspections by national government and local authorities
determine in large part how a facility is designed, used and maintained. All organisations,
regardless of size and resources, must comply with these requirements as part of their
responsibilities to their staff and visitors.
  
Buildings, grounds, plant and machinery are provided and maintained and do not pose
hazards to the occupants. Utility systems (electrical, water, ventilation and other utility
systems) are maintained to minimize the risks of operating failures. Ensuring that buildings,
grounds, plant and machinery are provided and maintained requires that staff be
knowledgeable and competent.
