5.Patient and Family Rights
5.1 Implementation of Patient Rights
5.1.1 Standard
The organisation provides processes that support patients' and families' rights
during transport and care.
Standard Intent: An organisation's leaders are primarily responsible for the way in which that
organisation treats its patients. The leaders need to know and understand patient and family
rights and their organisation's responsibilities as specified in laws, charters and regulations.
The leaders then provide direction to ensure that the personnel throughout the organisation
assume responsibility for protecting these rights. To effectively protect and advance patient
rights, the leaders work collaboratively and seek to understand their responsibilities in
relation to the community served by the organisation.
  
Patient and family rights are a fundamental element of all contacts between the personnel of
an organisation and patients and families. Thus, policies and procedures are developed and
implemented to ensure that all personnel are aware of and respond to patient and family
rights issues, including their role in supporting the right of patients and families to participate
in the care process.

5.1.2 Standard
The organisation takes measures to protect patient privacy.
Standard Intent: The organisation ensures that the patient's needs for privacy are respected,
especially when the patient is providing personal information and undergoing clinical
examination. Patients may desire privacy from other staff, other patients and even from
family members.
  
Medical and other health information, when documented and collected in a patient record or
other form, is important for understanding the patient, his or her needs, and for providing
care and services over time. The organisation respects such information as confidential and
has implemented policies and procedures that protect such information from loss or misuse.
The misuse of patient information can result in the patient's loss of dignity, employment and
damage to personal or family relationships.
  
When the organisation takes responsibility for any or all of the patient's personal
possessions brought into the organisation, there is a process to account for those
possessions and to ensure that they will not be lost or stolen. This process considers the
possessions of emergency patients, those patients unable to make alternative safekeeping
arrangements and those incapable of making decisions regarding their possessions. The
organisation communicates its responsibility, if any, for the patient's possessions to patients
and families.

5.Patient and Family Rights
5.1.3 Standard
The organisation has a policy on initiating resuscitative services.
Standard Intent: Decisions about withholding resuscitative services or forgoing or withdrawing
life-sustaining treatment are among the most difficult choices facing patients, families, health
professionals and organisations. No single process can anticipate all the situations in which
such decisions must be made. For this reason, it is important for the organisation to develop
a framework for making these difficult decisions.
  
Such a framework:
  
•                     helps the organisation identify its position on these issues
•                     ensures that the organisation's position conforms to its community's religious and
cultural norms and to any legal or regulatory requirements
•                     addresses situations in which these decisions are modified during care,  and
•                     guides health professionals through the ethical and legal issues in carrying out
such patient wishes.
  
To ensure that the decision-making process related to carrying out the patient's wishes is
applied consistently, policies and procedures are developed through a process that includes
many professionals and various viewpoints. The policies and procedures identify lines of
accountability and responsibility and how the process is documented in the patient's record.

5.1.5 Standard
The organisation has a defined consent process and lists those categories or types
of treatment and procedures that require specific informed consent.
Standard Intent: Informed consent may be obtained at several points in the care process. For
example, informed consent can be obtained before the patient enters the organisation or
before certain high-risk procedures or treatments.
  
Each organisation identifies those high-risk, problem-prone or other procedures and
treatments for which consent must be obtained. The organisation lists these procedures and
treatments and educates the staff to ensure that the process to obtain consent is consistent.
Those who provide the treatments or perform the procedures develop the list collaboratively.
  
This consent process provides the information identified and documents the identity of the
individual providing the information.

The organisation informs patients and families about its process to receive and act
on complaints, conflicts and differences of opinion about patient care, and the
patient's right to participate in these processes.
Standard Intent: Patients have a right to voice complaints about their care and to have those
complaints reviewed and, where possible, resolved. Also, decisions regarding care
sometimes present questions, conflicts or other dilemmas for the organisation and the
patient, family or other decision-makers. These dilemmas may arise around issues of
access, treatment or discharge. They can be especially difficult to resolve when the issue
involves, for example, withholding resuscitative services or forgoing or withdrawing life-
sustaining treatment.
  
The organisation has established processes for seeking resolutions to such dilemmas and
complaints. The organisation identifies in policies and procedures those who need to be
involved in the processes and how the patient and family participate.
