1.1 Governance of the Organisation.
1.1.1 Standard
The responsibilities and accountability of the governance of the organisation are
documented and implemented by the organisation's managers.
Standard Intent: According to the Oxford dictionary to govern is "to conduct the policy, actions
and affairs of (a state, organisation or people) with authority."  The same source defines
governance as "the action or manner of governing a state, organisation, etc." It relates to
decisions that define expectations, grant power, or verify performance. It consists of either a
separate process or part of management or leadership processes.
  
A governing body is the group of people given the power and authority to govern an
organisation. Governing bodies can take the form of a board, a council, a steering
committee or an assembly of elders or traditional owners. Their role is to plan strategic
direction, set the organisation's goals, lead the organisation, make the policies and evaluate
and support the management and personnel.
  
There is a governing body responsible for directing the operation of the health facility which
is accountable for providing quality healthcare services to its community or to the population
that seeks care. The responsibilities and accountability of this entity are described in a
document that identifies how they are to be carried out, and are known to those responsible
for management within the health facility. The responsibilities of governing bodies lie
primarily in approving plans and documents submitted by the managers of the health facility.
Those elements of management requiring approval by governance are documented.
  
The process and practices that will apply will vary significantly given the environment in
which they are applied. Governance in the public sector, which includes ministries, boards
and similar entities, takes into account legal and constitutional accountability and
responsibilities.
  
In a business or non-profit organisation governance, in addition to legal and constitutional
accountability, relates to consistent management, policies, processes, guidance and
decision-rights for a given area of responsibility.
  
It is important that the health facility has clear leadership, operates efficiently and provides
quality healthcare services.  The lines of communication for achieving these goals are
presented in an organisational chart or other document.
