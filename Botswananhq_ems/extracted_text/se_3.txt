3.1 Financial Management Support
3.1.1 Standard
Budgeting, reporting and auditing processes are consistent with statutory
requirements and accepted standards.
Standard Intent: Financial planning and management needs to be conducted by a person who
is suitably qualified and experienced in all matters relating to the organisation's finances.
Clinical and other leaders need to be included in planning their financial requirements. They
also require information relating to the funds available to them for the management of their
departments, and up-to-date statements of current expenditure. Sound accounting and
auditing practices are implemented to ensure transparency. Financial managers improve
their services through quality improvement methods.

3.2 Provisioning and Supplies
3.2.1 Standard
There is a system to ensure that equipment and supplies are ordered, available,
stored and distributed from a central point.
Standard Intent: A competent and qualified person ensures the effective administration of the
provisioning department. This includes timely ordering of equipment and supplies, safe
storage, prevention and notification of losses, effective distribution to departments on
request, and maintenance of information relating to ordering, receipt, storage and
distribution of equipment and supplies. Managers need to be assured that all equipment and
supplies needed by departments will be immediately available on request. Policies and
procedures guide the processes of provisioning management.
The organisation's leaders need to ensure that finances are made available for the purchase
of those items of equipment and supplies which have been identified as needed by clinical
and managerial leaders. The provisioning managers therefore need to work closely with the
financial manager.

3.3 Health Record Maintenance
3.3.1 Standard
There is a system for storage of health records which meets the needs of
confidentiality and safety.
Standard Intent: Health record management must be implemented by a person with suitable
training and experience. The manager controls the safe storage and retrieval of files. Files
must be readily available each time the patient visits a health professional, and therefore
must be filed in such a way that they are easily identified. Policies and procedures as well as
managerial supervision ensure the safety and confidentiality of files. Loss of information may
be through electronic failure, fire, flood or theft. The organisation develops and implements a
policy that guides the retention of patient records and other data and information. Patient
records and other data and information are retained for sufficient periods to comply with
laws and regulations and support patient care, the management of the organisation, legal
documentation, research and education. The retention policy is consistent with the
confidentiality and security of such information. When the retention period is complete,
patient records and other data and information are destroyed appropriately.
